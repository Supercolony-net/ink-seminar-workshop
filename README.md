This repo is the rewriting of this blog post [minimum viable exchange in Solidity](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/%EF%B8%8F-minimum-viable-exchange-d84f30bd0c90e) into [ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink) & [OpenBrush](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts).

To find more about best project structure please check [OpenBrush documentation](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/blob/c71097ff10ef6d187bf9c86f0248bfbc6ec40a3c/docs/docs/smart-contracts/example/setup_project.md) or our [OpenBrush Substrate Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5OFGNVvzOc)

To compile the smart contracts please use [cargo contracts](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract)
